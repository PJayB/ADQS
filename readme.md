Audio Device Quick-Switcher (ADQS)
==================================

This is a work in progress, currently in the "hacked together over a weekend" stage. Looking for high-level architectural fails first, before moving onto cleaner C# sugar, then documentation.

This is a front-end for Belphemur's fantastic [AudioEndPointLibrary](https://github.com/Belphemur/AudioEndPointLibrary/).
