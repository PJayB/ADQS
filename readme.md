Issues
======

* Occasional stall when setting the default device. Maybe queue on a different thread?
* Window remains open if user uses Win+Space to switch language.
* Need to move window to bottom right of current monitor.
* Need a configuration page to allow users to select a different hotkey, optionally hide inputs and quit the application.
